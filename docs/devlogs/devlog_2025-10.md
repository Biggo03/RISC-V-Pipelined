# October

## October. 4th

### Notes:
Today was primarily focused on establishing comprehensive project documentation.  
I created a structured set of documents under the `docs/` directory covering all high-level topics related to the processor’s design and supporting infrastructure. This includes a central `README` outlining the purpose of each document and subdirectory, as well as a new `roadmap.md` file defining near- and long-term development priorities. The roadmap is intended to formalize my direction for the project and reduce sprawl, which became an issue over the past month.

The focus was on defining high-level documents that describe major design areas, along with spreadsheet files for organizing key control signal and instruction information. These will be crucial for maintaining consistency and supporting future expansion. The block-level documents remain as placeholders for now and will be populated as the design matures.  
The overall goal for the documentation structure is to balance stability and extensibility — central documents should only require occasional updates, while detailed leaf documents can evolve alongside the hardware.

### Summary:
- Created a complete set of high-level project documents.  
- Added a roadmap to define project direction and prevent sprawl.  
- Introduced spreadsheets for control signal and instruction organization.  
- Added skeletons for block-level documentation to be filled progressively.
