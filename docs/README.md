# Processor Documentation

This directory contains all design and development documentation for the RISC-V processor project.

## Overview of Structure

### Core Documentation (`/core_docs`)
High-level specification files covering the processor architecture, pipeline organization, memory system, supported instructions, and verification methodology.

### Block Documentation (`/blocks`)
Module-level documentation providing overviews of key RTL components and their interactions within the processor.

### Spreadsheets (`/spreadsheets`)
Structured data files defining control signals, CSR mappings, and instruction decode information referenced throughout the documentation.

### Development Logs (`/devlogs`)
Chronological records of implementation progress, design decisions, and verification updates.

### Roadmap (`roadmap.md`)
Outlines current development focus areas, priorities, and planned architectural and infrastructure enhancements.

### Style Guide (`style_guide.md`)
Defines naming conventions, formatting standards, and documentation guidelines for the project.

All documentation is designed to be internally consistent and cross-referenced.  
This structure separates high-level specifications, subsystem documentation, and development records to ensure clarity and maintainability as the project evolves.
